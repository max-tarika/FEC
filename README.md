## Project Overview:

Welcome to the year 2021. We are living in a crazy time, where the **present** and the **future** are _synonymous_...

Companies are now being increasingly tasked with **upkeeping** their products to use modern _trends_, _styles_, and _characteristics_. This sizeable amount of constantly-evolving workload can create an incredibly challenging and **stressful** daily life for the engineers assigned to completing these tasks... _That is where we come in_.

_**The Island Boys**_, established November 2021, jumped into this project with two missions:

* To **modernize** an out-of-date web application.
* To do this in a fashion that **destroys** the perception that working today has to be a stressful event. _Catch some waves as you go!_

## From local directory,

1) Install dependencies by running `npm install`

  * <img src="./client/dist/img/packageJSON.png" width="50%">

2) You'll need to use your own **access token** and create your own **config.js** file:

  * _See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to get started with a free github token_

  * _Next you'll just need to add the token and your campus code to config.js_

  <img src="./client/dist/img/config.png" width="80%">

3) Almost ready! Now that you've installed dependencies and set up authorization you can start the server:

  * _Make sure you compile the .jsx files with webpack. Run_ `npm run pack` _in a terminal window..._

  <img src="./client/dist/img/webpack.png" width="50%">

  * _In another terminal window, start the server by running_ `npm run server`

  <img src="./client/dist/img/server.png" width="50%">

4) With webpack and the server running, open [**http://localhost:3000**](http://localhost:3000) in your favorite browser and enjoy!
